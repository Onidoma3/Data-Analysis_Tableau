Digitalpath Innovations, a major stake holder in digital marketing solutions, seeks to enhance its websites user experience to improve engagement metrics, conversion rates and customer satisfaction. The Company has conducted an A/B test over a two week period , presenting two distinct versions of its webpage to a randomized group of users. This experiment aims to identify which webpage version performs better across various user engagement metrics.				
The Management of Digitalpath Innovations has compiled a detailed dataset	 capturing user interactions, behaviors and responses to each webpage version. This dataset as seen by my team presents a unique opportunity for us to analyze the effectiveness of each design, inform future design iterations and ultimately enhance user experience based on data-driven insights.
Using Tableau, we were able to analyze the dataset,the insights and recommendations are attached
